Indian Politics Essay:


Indian politics has undergone significant changes since independence in 1947. The country follows a democratic system, allowing citizens to elect their leaders through voting. India’s political structure is divided into three main branches: the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judiciary. The Parliament, which consists of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, plays a crucial role in lawmaking.

Over the years, Indian politics has witnessed the rise of multiple political parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Regional parties also hold significant influence in states like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh.

One major challenge in Indian politics is corruption, which affects governance and development. However, recent efforts like digitalization and strict laws have helped improve transparency. Elections are now conducted using Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), ensuring fair results.

As of 2024, India has over 96 crore registered voters, making it the world’s largest democracy. The youth play a vital role in shaping the future of the nation through informed voting. Indian politics continues to evolve, with a focus on development, economic growth, and global leadership.
